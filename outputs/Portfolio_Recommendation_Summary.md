| Portfolio               | Expected Return | Expected Volatility (Std. Dev.) | Sharpe Ratio | Asset Allocation                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|

## 3. Interpretation

### Minimum Volatility Portfolio
- **Risk:** Very low volatility at 5.40%, indicating relatively stable value with minimal fluctuations.
- **Return:** Negative expected return (-19.84%), which suggests this portfolio may lose value on average.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Negative (-3.68), implying poor risk-adjusted performance.
- **Asset Allocation:** Predominantly invested in TSLA (~95%), with a small allocation to BND (~5%).
  
**Insight:**  
Despite low volatility, the negative expected return and negative Sharpe ratio indicate this portfolio is unlikely to meet growth goals. The concentration in a highly volatile stock like TSLA with poor expected returns drives this result.

---

### Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
- **Risk:** High volatility at 59.19%, meaning the portfolio experiences significant value fluctuations.
- **Return:** Positive expected return at 14.48%, indicating potential for good growth.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Low positive value (0.24), showing modest reward for the risk taken.
- **Asset Allocation:** Fully invested in SPY, representing broad exposure to the U.S. equity market.

**Insight:**  
This portfolio targets the best return per unit of risk (Sharpe ratio) but at the cost of high volatility. It suits investors willing to accept significant short-term risk for potential long-term gains.

## 4. Recommendations

### Based on Risk Tolerance:

| Investor Profile               | Recommended Portfolio                    | Justification                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conservative / Risk-Averse** | Minimum Volatility (with caution)      | Low volatility is ideal, but negative expected returns require reviewing input data and assumptions carefully. |
| **Growth-Oriented / Risk-Tolerant** | Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio       | Offers positive returns and optimal risk-adjusted performance despite high volatility.                         |

---

### Important Notes:
- The **negative return on the Minimum Volatility portfolio** is unusual and suggests possible data quality issues or extreme asset behavior (e.g., TSLAâ€™s recent performance).
- The **Sharpe ratio of 0.24 for the Maximum Sharpe portfolio** is low compared to typical benchmarks (generally >1 is desirable).
- Investors should consider **additional portfolios between these two extremes** to find a more balanced risk-return profile.
- It's recommended to **review data inputs** such as historical returns, time periods, and asset selection to ensure accuracy.

---

## 5. Next Steps

- **Validate data quality:** Ensure accurate and sufficient historical price data for all assets.
- **Explore target volatility portfolios:** Construct portfolios targeting specific volatility levels between minimum volatility and max Sharpe points.
- **Scenario analysis:** Simulate portfolio performance under various market conditions.
- **Diversify asset classes:** Consider adding more assets or asset classes to improve portfolio stability and returns.

---

## 6. Final Recommended Portfolio Summary

Based on the analysis, the **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio** is recommended for investors prioritizing risk-adjusted returns with an acceptance of higher volatility.

| Asset | Optimal Weight |
|-------|----------------|
| TSLA  | 0.00%          |
| BND   | 0.00%          |
| SPY   | 100.00%        |

### Portfolio Metrics:
- **Expected Annual Return:** 14.48%
- **Expected Annual Volatility:** 59.19%
- **Sharpe Ratio:** 0.24

This portfolio offers the best balance of expected return per unit of risk in the current dataset, despite its high volatility. Investors should be prepared for substantial fluctuations in portfolio value.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio provides a reasonable growth-oriented choice given the available data. However, the unusual characteristics of the Minimum Volatility portfolio suggest further data validation is needed before using it for conservative strategies.

Exploring intermediate portfolios or adding more assets could improve the overall risk-return tradeoff.
